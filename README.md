This project represents sales prediction supervised machine learning models. The project’s data was downloaded from this source, and my understanding it is a fake dataset aimed to be used as exercises to apply machine learning models to predict sales.

This repository represents the steps taken to clean and visualize the dataset to better understand the data. Then evaluate different supervised machine learning algorithm models to predict item sales.

4 models were used:

The models’ results were then evaluated to determine the better fit regression model and came up with the following results.

I encourage you to view my presentation and dig deeper in the code.
